Accelerate the Calculations Related to Municipal Bonds

Florida Municipal Securities (FMS) (Miami): Modify python script to increase speed of price calculations for market making dealer. The municipal bond market is viewed as a sleepy ~3.9 trillion corner of the broader fixedincome market, it is anything but. Electronification has been on the rise over the lastdecade, and with ~1 million distinct active securities (dwarfing the security counts of USGovts and Corporate Bonds), speed of calculation is of paramount importance. The latency requirements here are still lax compared to those of equities, options, and rates, but~1second to perform a price-to-yield calculation is still far too slow. The goal of this project is to achieve a meaningful decrease in per-security calculation time of an analytics library written in Python. The project will begin with a series of meetings geared towards familiarizing the students with the municipal bond market, the library itself and the security master data which drives it.
